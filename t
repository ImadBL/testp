From our side, the email address has been added in the Inbox configuration/dossier.
However, we still don’t see any incoming emails coming through, so I’m not sure whether the Exchange-side configuration has been completed yet.

We’ll monitor it on our side, and if needed we will check with the IT Support/Exchange team.

Best regards,
